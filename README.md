# A Nike IN e-Commerce clone based on NextJS+Typescript

This is my attempt to create a Nike Clone to test out how close I can get to the International site level. It's been really fascinating journey so far where I learned about extremely complex layouts, seeing how much I still don't know about CSS. 

I will try to complete the whole site as soon as possible and keeping it as close to the original as possible.

Fonts and icons will mismatch a bit since I don't have the exact files for the obvious reasons.
